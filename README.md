# WinUI3_Problems_DragDropTreeView

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating the drag and drop capability from within a TreeView in both UWP and WinUI3 Desktop.

The UWP sample code works as expected. However, the WinUI3 Desktop sample code does not allow the user to move an item (drag and drop) inside the TreeView.
